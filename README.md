User’s guide 
The environment of the software is very easy. You just need to download the software.Most of the AEE students in UNNC are Chinese, so the language of the calculator is Chinese. There are four variables in the calculator. The calculator has the unit of the variable. If we give three precise values in the four variables in in a relevant long rectangle, the calculator can show the value of the other variable in the remaining one rectangle. If the user does not input three values, the calculator would show that please input three values to calculate. If the values are not numbers, the calculator would show that please sure the input is the number.
